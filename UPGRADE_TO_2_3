# EntityGenerator add*() method generation

When generating an add*() method for a collection the EntityGenerator will now not
use the Type-Hint to get the singular for the collection name, but use the field-name
and strip a trailing "s" character if there is one.

# Merge copies non persisted properties too

When merging an entity in UoW not only mapped properties are copied, but also others.
