# EntityGenerator add*() method generation

When generating an add*() method for a collection the EntityGenerator will now not
use the Type-Hint to get the singular for the collection name, but use the field-name
and strip a trailing "s" character if there is one.

# Merge copies non persisted properties too

When merging an entity in UoW not only mapped properties are copied, but also others.

# Query, QueryBuilder and NativeQuery parameters *BC break*

From now on, parameters in queries is an ArrayCollection instead of a simple array.
This affects heavily the usage of setParameters(), because it will not append anymore
parameters to query, but will actually override the already defined ones.
Whenever you are retrieving a parameter (ie. $query->getParameter(1)), you will
receive an instance of Query\Parameter, which contains the methods "getName",
"getValue" and "getType". Parameters are also only converted to when necessary, and
not when they are set.

Also, related functions were affected:

* execute(ArrayCollection $parameters, $hydrationMode)
* iterate(ArrayCollection $parameters, $hydrationMode)
* setParameters(ArrayCollection $parameters)
* getParameters()
* getParameter($key)
